## Design Decisions
The bee theme was chosen as a reference to the "hive-mind" concept and their incredible ability to work together to creat something beautiful - shown in the honeycomb hero image.

Colour Scheme was generated using Coolors and refernces colours from the hero image. Font colours were checked against the background colours to ensure readability and adherence to accesibility standards. Fonts "Oxanium" for titles and "Zilla Slab" for main body text were imported from Google Fonts and chosen due to the geometic

### Accessibility Considerations
Colour contrast standards were adhered to throughout and aria-labels were useed for all links alongside alt tags for images.  


## AI Tools Usage

### FreePiks

I used FreePiks to find and/or generate my images and logos as well as to remover the background from these images

I used ChatGPT to prompt my research and to find links to research to include in my resources section.

## Deployment

### Deployment Process
Site was deployed through GitHub Pages and the deployed site was regularly checked for bugs during development.
## AI Tools Usage

### Reflection
Describe the role AI tools played in the deployment process, including any benefits or challenges.  
**Guidance:** Reflect on how AI tools assisted with the deployment process, particularly how they streamlined any tasks or presented challenges.

## Reflection on Development Process

### Successes
I generated my own favicon and learned how to create images easily using AI such as FreePiks which I will deinitley employ for future design projects. I also put into practise Bootstrap which was highly benificial to my overall understanding and made the design process far easier.

### Challenges
I had some time pressures towards the end after losing some HTML code for my content and didn't have as much time to refine - on xl screens the navbar isn't rendered properly and my content is not fleshed out.

## Code Attribution
I used code from the Bootsrap v5 library and some small snippets from StackOverflow users to help with customising bootstrap components. Otherwise, all code was written by myself thanks to the training I have undertaken so far at the Code Institute.

## Future Improvements
Given more time, more content would've been added to the page that unfortunately was lost in the final stages of development. More pages including differennt content types such as video would also benefit the project in the future.
