## AI Tools Usage

### FreePiks

I used FreePiks to find and/or generate my images and logos as well as to remover the background from these images

### ChatGPT
I used ChatGPT to prompt my research and to find links to research to include in my resources section.


## Features Implementation

### Core Features (Must-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature.
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature.

(Include all must-have features)  
**Guidance:** Use this section as you complete Phase 2: Must User Stories Implementation & Testing. Document all the must-have features you implemented, explaining how they align with the user stories and acceptance criteria.

### Advanced Features (Should-Haves)
- **Feature 1:** Description of the implemented feature.
- **Feature 2:** Description of the implemented feature.
